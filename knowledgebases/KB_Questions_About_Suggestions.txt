Knowledge Base 2 (Questions about Preditive Recommendations)

Q: What are the side effects of using pesticies?
Alternative Q: What are the tradeoffs when using pesticides?

	    "answer": "Healthy soil is basis of healthy plans. Of the 1y or so elements thought to be essential for platn growth, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are the most important.  They are known as primary or macronutrients because plants take them from the soil in the largest amounts. Fertilizers that contain all threer of these nutrients are labeled complete fertilizers, but they are harderly complete in an absolute sense. One way to determine what minerals are lacking is to get it testee. Consult our partners located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada that offer low cost soil tests.",
